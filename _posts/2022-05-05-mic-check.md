This is just a test post to make sure that the machine is all wired up.

But if some future person bothered to go back and find post zero, as it were, let me leave you with this poem that offered great inspiration to me:

```
A thousand times I have ascertained and
found it to be true:

The affairs of this world are really nothing
into nothing.

Still though, we should dance.

-Hafiz
